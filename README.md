# Minecraft AI Command Bot

A Minecraft bot that understands and executes Hebrew natural language commands using a custom-trained neural network. The bot connects to a Minecraft server, listens to chat messages, and performs in-game actions such as moving, digging, fighting zombies, and managing inventory — all controlled by user commands processed through machine learning.

---

## Features

- **Hebrew Natural Language Processing:** Tokenizes and understands Hebrew commands using a neural network built with PyTorch.
- **Custom Command Learning:** Allows live learning of new commands directly from Minecraft chat.
- **Minecraft Automation:** Controls the bot with Mineflayer and plugins for pathfinding, PvP combat, and armor management.
- **PvP & Mob Fighting:** Automatically detects and attacks hostile mobs like zombies.
- **Inventory & Armor Management:** Automatically equips armor and collects nearby items.
- **Real-time JS Command Execution:** The Python AI process sends JavaScript commands to the bot in real-time.
- **Easy Extensibility:** Add or modify commands with corresponding JavaScript snippets.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Node.js 16+**
- **Minecraft Java Edition server access** (can be local or public)
- Python packages:
  - `torch`
  - `nltk`
- Node.js packages:
  - `mineflayer`
  - `mineflayer-pathfinder`
  - `mineflayer-pvp`
  - `mineflayer-armor-manager`

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
2. Install Python dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install torch nltk
Note: You may need to install PyTorch following instructions from https://pytorch.org for your OS and CUDA support.

3. Install Node.js dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install mineflayer mineflayer-pathfinder mineflayer-pvp mineflayer-armor-manager vec3
4. Configure Minecraft server connection
Edit the generate_bot_js() function in the Python script to set your Minecraft server host, port, username, and Minecraft version.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
const bot = mineflayer.createBot({
  host: 'your.server.address',
  port: 25565,
  username: 'BotUsername',
  version: '1.20.1'
})
Running the Bot
Run the main Python script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
The script will:

Load or train the AI command model.

Generate the bot JavaScript file (bot.js).

Launch the Minecraft bot process (node bot.js).

Listen to Minecraft chat messages and send commands to the bot accordingly.

Using the Bot
Commands
Send Hebrew chat messages in Minecraft to control the bot.

Commands can be simple phrases like "לך קדימה" (move forward), "קפוץ" (jump), or "הפעל יצירתיות" (enable creative mode).

The AI will try to recognize and execute matching commands automatically.

Teaching New Commands
You can teach the bot new commands on the fly by typing in Minecraft chat:

php-template
Copy
Edit
!למד פקודה | <command text> | <JavaScript code>
For example:

bash
Copy
Edit
!למד פקודה | ברך | bot.chat('שלום חבר!');
The bot will learn this new command and be able to execute it next time you send the phrase "ברך".

Manual Control (Python Console)
You can also type commands directly into the Python console. The AI will parse and send the corresponding JavaScript commands to the bot.

Type exit to stop the bot.

How It Works
The Python script runs a PyTorch neural network trained to classify Hebrew input phrases into command labels.

Each label corresponds to a JavaScript snippet that controls the Minecraft bot.

The bot runs with Mineflayer and plugins for navigation, PvP, and armor management.

The bot listens to chat and standard input, executing JavaScript commands it receives.

The Python process acts as the AI brain and command dispatcher.

Troubleshooting
Make sure your Minecraft server is reachable and the connection details in generate_bot_js() are correct.

Verify Python and Node.js dependencies are installed properly.

If the bot does not respond, check the console logs for errors.

Adjust the AI confidence threshold or add more training examples if commands are not recognized reliably.
